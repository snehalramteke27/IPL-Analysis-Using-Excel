****IPL-Analysis-Using-Excel****

IPL is a popular cricket series played annually in India since 2008. So, we have generated a lot of data since then which helps in prediction of the future performances of teams and players. I have analysed the data which covers the various objectives-

* Clean Data Before Dashboard Development.

* Use of Pivot Table and Pivot Chart.

* To compare the teams by their count number of match wins against each other.

* To find out the popular playgrounds.

* To show the toss distribution of teamâ€™s at different venues.
